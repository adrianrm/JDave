Note, there's not yet any real scala support but this sample can be a starting point.

1. install scala eclipse plugin
2. get latest jdave-core + jdave-junit4 1.0-SNAPSHOTS from laughingpanda maven repo
3. import both projects found in scala-sample.tgz into eclipse
4. run the suite found from Java project
